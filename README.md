# Hey There :wave:

This was a little project I made during the 48-72hr hackathon in the SDCS hackathon project.  We had to take what we have learned so far and make something.  I choose to make a simple MEME getter app hitting the Tenor Api and another hitting a dog photo/gif Api. 

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  

## ENJOY! :thumbsup:
